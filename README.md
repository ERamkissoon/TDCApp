# Technician Data Collection Application

This application is being developed as a means of expediting the processes of the technician. It provides access to the
Machine Movement, Part Movement, BV, and Conversion forms and would allow for technicians to print their sessions, providing a
physical receipt.

By the addition of this application, there is a potential to integrate the data entered into the system with BackOffice.
